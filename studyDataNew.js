      "3": "Insulin (a hormone that allows the cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar from the blood) and β-adrenergic tone (a group of organs and nerves where hormones are able to signal to other cells) also help keep potassium (K+) distribution at normal levels.",
      "4": "Despite these different systems, disorders of changing K+ levels are common.",
      "5": "Understanding the pathophysiology (physical changes that come with a particular syndrome or disease) and regulating processes that determine how the body distributes and balances K+ is key to developing treatments to restore K+ homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal potassium concentration in the fluid).",
      "6": "Researchers review the normal regulating process of total-body potassium (K+) before highlighting common disorders in K+ homeostasis and their treatment.",
      "7": "This review of K+ homeostasis is a resource for health care providers and a tool for educators teaching students to understand key factors involved in K+ balance."

      "1": "Mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell) play several important roles in the body.",
      "2": "These roles include providing energy and participating in pathways of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection).",
      "3": "The event of mitochondria increasing inflammation is associated with the release of products from mitochondrial damage.",
      "4": "One of these products is mitochondrial DNA which can increase inflammation within the body.",
      "5": "This review aimed to show the importance of the mitochondria in energy production and in the intervention in the development of several diseases, mainly COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory disease).",
      "6": "Additionally the paper aimed to show how the mitochondria organelle uses several different ways to allow the replication and maintenance of a virus.",
      "7": "This can lead to the worsening and spread of inflammation.",
      "8": "The reviewed scientific evidence suggested that mitochondria are involved in the replication of COVID-19.",
      "9": "The virus forms double-walled vesicles, a small chamber outside or within a cell, that evades detection by the host's immune system.",
      "10": "These vesicles can then damage mitochondria within cells, releasing mitochondrial DNA into the body.",
      "11": "This can trigger the innate immune system, the defense system you were born with, which increase inflammation within the body.",
      "12": "This review concluded that while the role of the mitochondria in COVID-19 is still being studied, the use of mitochondrial DNA as an indicator of illness is a potential area yet to be researched."

      "1": "SARS-CoV-2 infection (a viral lung infection) can cause effects ranging from patients with no symptoms to life-threatening conditions.",
      "2": "Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe lung effect and develop altered levels of immune cells and strikingly increased levels of IL-6 (an immune signaling molecule called a cytokine).",
      "3": "There is an increased cytokine release with hyperferritinemia (high levels of ferritin - an iron-containing protein).",
      "4": "This leads to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome disease group.",
      "5": "Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still's disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock (immune- or infection-related diseases).",
      "6": "Many studies have shown the immune-system-regulating effects of ferritin and its links with death risks and high inflammation.",
      "7": "High levels of free iron are harmful in the body, especially through damage that can lead to scarring.",
      "8": "Iron binding represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload.",
      "9": "Also, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-scarring activity.",
      "10": "Herein, we analyse the disease-causing role of ferritin and iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose iron depletion treatment as a new treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic."
